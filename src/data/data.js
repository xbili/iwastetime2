I hate to reduce an apocalyptic-galactic scenario to how I spend my Saturday afternoons, or to somehow equate my desire to pass time away with the Divine Force of the Universe - but look at me, look at what I'm doing. I take this long to tell you that a) I procrastinate by watching movies illegally on the Internet, b) because gravity, the increasing burden of my body, that other awesome film featuring Sandra Bullock, etc. etc...",
