      "Modern society comes with its perks; the freedom of capital, labour and resources means that you and I get to enjoy the newest music, the newest fashion and taste the most exotic food from the comforts of our home. Our modern society is a connected society, a convenient society. But what if such conveniences and comforts come with hidden costs? Costs that we are unaware of?",
      "Our luxuries often help us to numb ourselves from the truth that is staring blatantly at us, that despite all its goodies, modern society is a cult of work obsessed with efficiency, addicted to productivity. Like cogs in a machine, we wake up at the same time, have lunch at the same time; we take the same train, see the same soulless face, have the same soulless conversations. We are caught in an orgy of competition caught in a rat race in a hamster wheel and an eternal paper chase.",
      "Like our capitalistic and materialistic society, social media has brought us the most entertaining memes, the most unforgettable viral videos and the most ear catching music. But it also brings to our eyes pictures upon pictures, statuses upon statuses, of how other people spend their time - the food they eat, the clothes they wear, the holiday destinations they visit. Social media, this virtual colosseum, brings to the online world competitive spirit of our modern society and magnifies it. What soon emerges are feelings of guilt, shame and restlessness whenever we procrastinate.",
      "If we worked harder, we could afford that expensive holiday that classmate from primary school took last summer.",
      "If we wasted less time, we’d be able to buy that bag your third cousin bought with last year’s bonus.",
