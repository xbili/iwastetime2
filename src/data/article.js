    "content": "<h3>On Wasting Time</h3> <p>How do we 'waste' time? Time, after all, is neither corporeal nor tangible. We exist in time; our lives are everywhere singularly connected with time. It is not an abstracted notion that we can actively consume, nor is it something that imposes itself upon us, as much as we think it is so.</p> <p>When we speak of 'wasting' time we conceive of time as a resource, a valuable one at that. When we waste resources we imply that it has not been properly put into use, and its value has not been expended in an idealised, optimised manner. Time, is, literally 'money'.</p> <p>Under the 'Learn' column here, we seek to uncover the origins and discover the implications of talking about time as a resource, determined in value and limited in reserve. We talk about why a simple search on Google Ngram reveals that the use of phrases such as \"waste time\" and \"wasting time\" has seen a specific increase from the 1800s. We talk about what wasting time means in our social lives.</p> <p>All in all, through the articles below, we hope you learn that 'wasting' time is merely a convention we have adopted. Everyone inevitably 'wastes' time, but whether one considers time 'wasted' is entirely subjective, oriented around our views of time.</p> <p>We hope you enjoying wasting time with us!</p> <p>Because #iwastetime2.</p> <h3>The Age of Capitalism</h3> <p>Modern society comes with its perks; the freedom of capital, labour and resources means that you and I get to enjoy the newest music, the newest fashion and taste the most exotic food from the comforts of our home. Our modern society is a connected society, a convenient society. But what if such conveniences and comforts come with hidden costs? Costs that we are unaware of?</p> <p>Our luxuries often help us to numb ourselves from the truth that is staring blatantly at us, that despite all its goodies, modern society is a cult of work obsessed with efficiency, addicted to productivity. Like cogs in a machine, we wake up at the same time, have lunch at the same time; we take the same train, see the same soulless face, have the same soulless conversations. We are caught in an orgy of competition caught in a rat race in a hamster wheel and an eternal paper chase.</p> <p>Like our capitalistic and materialistic society, social media has brought us the most entertaining memes, the most unforgettable viral videos and the most ear catching music. But it also brings to our eyes pictures upon pictures, statuses upon statuses, of how other people spend their time - the food they eat, the clothes they wear, the holiday destinations they visit. Social media, this virtual colosseum, brings to the online world competitive spirit of our modern society and magnifies it. </p> <p>If we worked harder, we could afford that expensive holiday that classmate from primary school took last summer. </p> <p>If we wasted less time, we'd be able to buy that bag your third cousin bought with last year's bonus. </p> <h3>Praising Idleness</h3> <p class=\"quote\">\"The morality of work is the morality of slaves, and the modern world has no need of slavery.\"</p> <p class=\"text-right\"> — Bertrand Russell, In Praise of Idleness</p> <p>What do we mean when we say we procrastinate? Beyond merely putting off work for the time being, inherent within procrastination is a deeply felt sense of guilt for being unproductive. Even if we are on holiday, technology and connectivity have made it hard for us to escape the clutches of modern society. So shackled are we to labour and work that any time spent not doing work is deemed as procrastination, although we employ words such as leisure and recreation to assuage and mask our guilt.Where are we to find the origin of this guilt? Certainly it is not immanently hardwired into our system, but rather everywhere an ubiquitous pressure placed on us when we regulate our lives in schedules, deadlines and timetables.</p> <p>Productivity is the doctrine of the age of capitalism, and it approaches a truism to say that the modern man lives in a capitalistic world. So pervasive is this cult that we cannot take leisure time without feeling it gnawing at our bones. The religious terms here are perfectly adequate. Bertrand Russell (and so many other eminent thinkers) have argued that the ethic of disciplined labour finds its roots in religious discourses, appropriated to serve the ends of industrial capitalism. The proliferation of capitalism all over has infused the morality of hard work deep into the lifeblood of society.</p> <p>But leisure time is also essential to civilisation. Culture and science have only progressed through leisure. It is not hard to see that the greatest philosophers, writers, inventors, thinkers, politicians and scientists have advanced the disciplines of knowledge we have today in part due to taking part in active pleasure.</p> <p>Procrastination and idleness then, are negative insofar as we participate in capitalistic discourse, rife with unpleasant connotations. Time off work can constitute active pleasures, the pursuit of what may inherently be valuable, purposeful and meaningful to our lives. Reconnecting with friends and families, indulging in personal hobbies, or merely taking time to plumb the depths of one's self and to take stock of one's life course. Even passive pleasures in television, videos, social media and the internet are not altogether inane or trivia. Take this site for example. Where you would have believed that you procrastinated by reading this article, you would have learned much more about attitudes towards procrastination itself.</p> <p>So now.</p> <p>Why don't we lie back and 'waste' time?</p> <p>Take heart. For #iwastetime2.</p>"
